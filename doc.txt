Setup:
laravel:
Once you've cloned this repository, You will need to be inside that project file to enter all of the rest of the commands
 in this tutorial. So remember to type cd tp-igl to move your terminal working location to the project file we just
 barely created. (Of course substitute “tp-igl” in the command above, with the name of the folder you created in the
 previous step) then run the following commands:

   composer install :When we run composer, it checks the composer.json file which is submitted to the github repo and lists all of the composer (PHP) packages that your repo requires. Because these packages are constantly changing, the source code is generally not submitted to github, but instead we let composer handle these updates. 
   npm install: where we installed the composer PHP packages, but this is installing the Javascript (or Node) packages required. The list of packages that a repo requires is listed in the packages.json file which is submitted to the github repo.
   cp .env.example .env :.env files are not generally committed to source control for security reasons. But there is a .env.example which is a template of the .env file that the project expects us to have. So we will make a copy of the .env.example file and create a .env file that we can start to fill out to do things like database configuration.
   php artisan key:generate :If you check the .env file again, you will see that it now has a long random string of characters in the APP_KEY field. We now have a valid app encryption key.
[this is not a command]Database connection:connect to your mysql database using the username root with an impty password.
    php artisan migrate: It’s not a bad idea to check your database to make sure everything migrated the way you expected.
    [Optional]php artisan db:seed : add dummy data your database to test it.
